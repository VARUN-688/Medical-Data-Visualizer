# Medical Data Visualizer

This project is part of the 'Data Analysis with Python' certification from freeCodeCamp. The objective of this project is to visualize and analyze medical data to derive meaningful insights and ensure data quality.

## Project Overview

The 'Medical Data Visualizer' project involves working with a medical dataset to accomplish the following tasks:

1. **Overweight Classification**: Add a column to the dataset to classify individuals as overweight based on BMI.
2. **Data Normalization**: Normalize categorical features (cholesterol and glucose levels) to ensure consistency in interpretation.
3. **Categorical Feature Visualization**: Convert the data into long format and create visualizations to show the distribution of categorical features, split by cardiovascular condition.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Filter out incorrect or outlier data points to ensure accuracy in analysis.
5. **Correlation Matrix**: Generate and visualize a correlation matrix to identify relationships between different variables.
